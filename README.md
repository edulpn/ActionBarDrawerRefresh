ActionBarDrawerRefresh
======================

This project is a template for future projects. It is, basically, a main activity that contains a FrameLayout in the center. DrawerLayout (from support v4) with a fragment as the content. ActionBar-PullToRefresh (https://github.com/chrisbanes/ActionBar-PullToRefresh) for refreshing.
